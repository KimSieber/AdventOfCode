Description:
This program is designed for the Advent of Code 2024, Day 04 challenge titled "Ceres Search".
It reads a field of characters from a file, searches for specific patterns ("XMAS" and "X-MAS")
within this field, and counts their occurrences.

File Input:
- The program expects an input file named "#04 Puzzle.txt" located in the same directory as the script.
- The file should contain a grid of characters, each line representing one row of the grid.

Usage:
1. Ensure the input file "#04 Puzzle.txt" is in the same directory as this script.
2. Run the script using a Python 3 interpreter.

Functionality:

Part I: Counting "XMAS"
- The function `check_xmas(field: list, x: int, y: int) -> int` checks if the string "XMAS" appears starting from the position (x, y) in any direction.
- It uses the nested function `check_direction(add: list) -> bool` to check specific directions based on coordinate adjustments.
- The script iterates over the grid to count how many times "XMAS" appears in any direction.

Part II: Counting "X-MAS"
- The function `check_X_mas(field: list, x: int, y: int) -> bool` checks if the character "X" at position (x, y) is part of the pattern "X-MAS".
- It verifies if "X" is surrounded by the letters "MAS" or "SAM" in specific diagonal patterns.
- The script iterates over the grid to count how many times "X-MAS" appears.

Output:
- The program prints the number of occurrences for both "XMAS" and "X-MAS".

Example Output:
PART I: How many times does XMAS appear? : [count]
PART II: How many times does X-MAS appear? : [count]

Note:
- Adjustments to the input file format or the search patterns may be needed for different challenges or datasets.
